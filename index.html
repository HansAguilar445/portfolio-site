			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>
				I am Hans Aguilar, a student of the PTEC program, currently studying 
				software and web development at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and 
				Technology. I specialize in programming, but I also do some story 
				writing and gaming on the side. In terms of experience, the languages
				I have used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and Java, though I have not
				used Java enough for it to truly count here.

				<div class="column column-6 column-3">
					<div class="html">
						<h3>HTML</h3>
						<p>
							I have two years of experience with HTML. With it, I have made many web pages, some with conventional
							designs as well as some experimental ones. They often have external icons and fonts.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="column column-6 column-3">
					<div class="c-sharp">
						<h3>C#</h3>
						<p>
							I have three years of experience with C#, mostly in the Unity Engine. In Unity, I have mostly worked
							on writing code for 2D projects, but I have dabbled in writing code for 3D games as experiments.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="column column-6 column-3">
					<div class="js">
						<h3>JavaScript</h3>
						<p>
							I have two years of experience with vanilla JavaScript. One of my favourite uses of it was generating 
							HTML elements in ways that made the site resemble a real social media platform.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="column column-6 column-3">
					<div class="css">
						<h3>CSS</h3>
						<p>
							I have two years of experience with CSS. With it, I have made some unconventional designs. One example
							would be my calculator website that I designed to look like Windows 10.
