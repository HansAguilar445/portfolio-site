			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>
				I am Hans Aguilar, a student of the PTEC program, currently studying 
				software and web development at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and 
				Technology. I specialize in programming, but I also do some story 
				writing and gaming on the side. In terms of experience, the languages
				I have used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and Java.

			<h2>My experience</h2>
			<div class="row-container">
				<div class="column html">
					<h3>HTML</h3>
					<p>
						I have two years of experience with HTML. I have made several web pages, some with conventional
						and normal designs as well as some experimental ones.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column c-sharp">
					<h3>C#</h3>
					<p>
						I have three years of experience with C#, mostly in the Unity Engine. In Unity, I have mostly worked
						on writing code for 2D projects, but I have dabbled in writing code for 3D games as experiments.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column java">
					<h3>Java</h3>
					<p>
						I have two years of experience with Java. I used it mostly for answering questions in the Canadian 
						Computing Challenge, so this is the language I have used the least.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column js">
					<h3>JavaScript</h3>
					<p>
						I have two years of experience with vanilla JavaScript. One of my favourite uses of it was generating 
						HTML elements in ways that made the site resemble a real social media platform.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column css">
					<h3>CSS</h3>
					<p>
						I have two years of experience with CSS. Using this, I have made some unusual designs such as an alarm that 
						looks like a phone on a table and a calculator that looks like the Windows 10 home screen.
					</p>
